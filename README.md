MOOC Java Exercises

This repository contains java exercises from Java Programming part I & Part II of the 
University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC). 

I actively engaged in the exercises, significantly enhancing my understanding of 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and expanding my knowledge in the process.
